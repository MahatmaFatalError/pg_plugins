plpgsql_cb
==========

This module is a PostgreSQL library which can be loaded at session level
of loaded directly with shared_preload_libraries in postgresql.conf making
use of PL/pgSQL plugin structure.  This does nothing fancy, using simple
logic to test the moments when the different callbacks are called for
a test of functions in the various regression tests.
