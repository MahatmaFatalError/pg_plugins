plpgsql_cb
==========

This module is a PostgreSQL library which can be loaded at session level
or loaded directly with shared_preload_libraries in postgresql.conf to
make use of PL/pgSQL plugin structure.  This does nothing fancy, using
a simple logic to test the moments when the different callbacks are called
using the given regression test set.
