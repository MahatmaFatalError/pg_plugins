pg_checksums, to control page-level checksums
=============================================

pg_checksums is a binary utility aimed at control page-level checksums
which have been introduced in PostgreSQL 9.3

Note that this module takes advantage in the new file permission facility
added in PostgreSQL 11, so the code is only able to compile using at least
that version.  if you wish to support older versions, feel free to fork
this code and create your own copy of it.

Installation
------------

Compiling pg_checksums is as simple as that once a set of PostgreSQL
libraries and binaries is installed.

    make install

In addition, pg_config must be in $PATH.

Usage
-----

pg_checksums is rather simple to use, and provides the following set
of options.

  * -d or --debug, to print more information about the operations
  being done.
  * -A or --action to do an operation on a stopped cluster.
  * --no-sync, to not wait for changes to be written safely to disk.

The set of actions supported is as follows:

  * "enable", which enables checksums in a cluster.  Note that all the
  relation pages need to be scanned and rewritten with the checksums
  calculated, so this may take time.  The control file is updated once
  all the relation pages are done with.
  * "disable", which disables checksums in a cluster.  This just switches
  checksums off in the control file.
  * "verify", which verifies the state of checksums on a cluster where
  they are enabled.

Note that the cluster being operated on needs to be cleanly shutdown
before running the operation to avoid problems with torn pages or
such.

This tool is inspired from pg_verify_checksums which has been introduced
in PostgreSQL 11 by Magnus Hagander and Daniel Gustafsson.
