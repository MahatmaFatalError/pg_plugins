scram_utils
===========

Set of utilities extending SCRAM properties by taking advantage of some
low-level APIs not directly exploitable by the user at SQL level. This
includes:
- scram_build_verifier(), a system function that can be used to update
  a SCRAM verifier with a low-level set of options compared to what
  upstreams offers since v10 by controlling the interation count and
  the salt length, salt which gets generated by pg_backend_random(), a
  strong random source. The verifier is built per RFC 7677, and updates
  pg_authid for the user given by caller.
